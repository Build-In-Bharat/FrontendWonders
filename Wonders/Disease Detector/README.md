The Disease Detector web application is designed to help users identify possible diseases based
on their symptoms. 

The HTML structure consists of several key sections, including a header with
navigation links (Home, Check Disease, About, Contact Us) and a main content area where users can
input their symptoms. 

The CSS styles enhance the visual appeal of the application, providing a
modern and user-friendly interface with a clean layout, rounded buttons, and a pleasing color 
palette that transitions from soft greens to pinks. .

The JavaScript functionality is implemented to handle user interactions; it 
detects the form submission, retrieves the input symptoms, and processes them to 
display potential disease matches dynamically. The script also includes animations for showing 
results and validation to improve user experience. Together, these components create an interactive
platform that not only informs users about potential health issues but also encourages them to seek 
further medical advice.

Algorithm on Topic-Intensive Agriculture Runoff Detection

1. Setup
- Input tape contains symbols representing water samples.


 2. States
- Q0: Start state
- Q1: Detect presence of pollutants
- Q2: Assess water quality
-Q3: Confirmation state
-Q4: Temporary state
- Q5: Accept state (if pollution detected)
- Q6: Reject state (if no pollution detected)

Short abbrevations used in turing machine

Pestisides -Pest
Residue-Res
Phosphorous -Phos
Nitrogen-Nitro
Sample-S
Oxygen-O2

Working

Q0: Start by moving right until the first symbol is encountered.
Q1: Detect pollutants by scanning the water sample symbols.
Transition to Q2 if the end of the water sample is reached without detecting any pollutants.
If pollutants are detected, continue scanning.
Q2: Assess water quality by scanning for additional pollutants or checking for oxygen levels.
If oxygen is present, transition to Q3 for confirmation.
If oxygen is not present, transition to Q4 for temporary storage.
Q3: Confirm presence of pollutants and transition to Q5 if confirmed.
Q4: Temporary state for processing additional symbols. If end of input is reached, transition to Q6.
Q5: Accept state, indicating pollution is detected.
Q6: Reject state, indicating no pollution is detected.

Algorithm:

Start in state Q0.
Move the tape head right until a symbol is encountered.
If the symbol is 'S' (sample), transition to state Q1.
In state Q1, scan the water sample for pollutants (Residues, Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Pesticides).
If no pollutants are found and the end of the sample is reached, transition to state Q2.
In state Q2, check for oxygen (O2) presence.
If oxygen is present, transition to state Q3 for confirmation.
If oxygen is not present, transition to state Q4 for temporary storage.
In state Q3, confirm the presence of pollutants and transition to state Q5 if confirmed.
In state Q4, process additional symbols until the end of input is reached.
If the end of input is reached without confirming pollutants, transition to state Q6.
State Q5 is the accept state, indicating pollution is detected.
State Q6 is the reject state, indicating no pollution is detected.
